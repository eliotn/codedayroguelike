<h2>How To Play:</h2>
<p>
    The idea of the game is to survive as long as you can<br />
    and get as many points as you can. To get points, you must<br />
    blow up the fish in the game by moving them within a bombs<br />
    blast radius and then explode the bomb. If the bomb explodes<br />
    while you are still in its blast radius, damage will be delt to<br />
    you. You want to try and get the points effeciently as possible<br />
    so, everytime you move, points are marked off to the total of your<br />
    score. Finally, you will need to make sure not to get stuck in a<br />
    wall. When you get close to the characters marked W they will create<br />
    a wall that you will get trapped in, so to avoid this you have to either<br />
    blow up the wall or get rid of it by running a fish into it.

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
	This game is based off of a freecodecamp project called Roguelike.<br />
	This game is mostly puzzle based, so different from the freecodecamp<br />
	edition of the game. We hope you enjoy!
