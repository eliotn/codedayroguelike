<h2>How To Play:</h2>
<p>
    You want to kill the boss because he made too many jokes about your mom.<br />
    Unfortunately he is surrounded by fish (jesusfish symbol), traps (w - inactive W-will explode),<br />
    mines (*), and kobolds (k).  However there are weapons and hearts for the brave to enable a "fair"<br>
    fight with the boss.<br>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
	This game is inspired by a freecodecamp project called Roguelike.<br />
	This game is more puzzle based, so different from the freecodecamp<br />
	edition of the game. We hope you enjoy!
